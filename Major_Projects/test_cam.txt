PROJECT: AI GESTURE-BASED HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION (HCI)
FILE: test_cam.py (Hardware Diagnostic Tool)
ROLE: Hardware Verification & Troubleshooting
================================================================

1. OVERVIEW
This is a lightweight diagnostic utility used to verify the 
connection between the Python environment and the physical 
camera hardware. It bypasses all AI processing (MediaPipe) to 
isolate hardware issues from software bugs [cite: 2026-01-04].

2. KEY FEATURES
A. DirectShow Integration:
- Uses 'cv2.CAP_DSHOW' to force the Windows video API to 
  establish a direct handshake with the webcam [cite: 2026-01-04].

B. Status Monitoring:
- Includes a conditional check ('if success') to confirm if 
  the camera is actually sending a valid data array [cite: 2026-01-04].
- Provides terminal feedback ("Hardware still not sending data") 
  if the stream is blocked or disconnected [cite: 2026-01-04].

3. FUNCTIONAL LOGIC
- Frame Capture: Continuously attempts to grab raw BGR frames 
  from the default camera index (0) [cite: 2026-01-04].
- Display: Opens a window named "Test" to show the live, 
  unprocessed camera feed [cite: 2026-01-04].
- Resource Management: Properly releases the camera hardware 
  and closes all windows upon exit to prevent "Ghost Processes" 
  from locking the camera for other apps [cite: 2026-01-04].

4. TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS
- If the window is black: The camera is likely being used by 
  another application (Zoom, Chrome, etc.) [cite: 2026-01-04].
- If it prints "Hardware still...": Check the camera privacy 
  settings in Windows or the physical privacy slider [cite: 2026-01-04].
- Exit: Press 'q' while the Test window is focused.
