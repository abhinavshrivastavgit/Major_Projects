PROJECT: Robot Health & System Diagnostic Monitor
AUTHOR: Abhinav Shrivastav
=====================================================

--- OVERVIEW ---
This diagnostic tool simulates real-time health monitoring for 
AI-driven robotics or edge-computing hardware. It translates 
raw system telemetry into actionable alerts, ensuring high 
availability and "Quality of Service" (QoS).

--- TECHNICAL LOGIC ---
1. TELEMETRY: Uses the 'psutil' library to pull real-time CPU and 
   RAM metrics.
2. THRESHOLD MANAGEMENT: Implements conditional "Guardrails":
   - CPU > 80%: Identifies processing bottlenecks.
   - RAM > 85%: Identifies crash risks due to memory leaks.
3. AUTOMATION: Configured to run iterative checks (polling) 
   to simulate continuous system monitoring.

--- PM VALUE PROPOSITION ---
As an AI PM, system reliability is a key product metric. This 
script demonstrates the logic required to build "Self-Healing" 
systems or proactive alerting dashboards that reduce system 
downtime and improve user trust.

--- DEPENDENCIES ---
- Python 'psutil' library
